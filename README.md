## Instructions

To get started, open `designs.js` and start building out the app's functionality.

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## Contributing

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.

## IMPORTANT NOTE!
This Project was created solely by the permission granted as a Udacity student. The only thing that was altered personally by me was the **design.js** file. The other files were created by Udacity. I simply designed the functionality of the script.

To view this Pixel art maker of my design, please download the full repo and open the **index.html** file in your browser.
